# a summary about you
summary: 'I’ve always dreamed of being a science guru ever since I was a kid. Following my deep passion for data and information analysis, I opted for the engineering program at Higher School of Statistics and Data Analysis (ESSAIT) Tunis. What I enjoy most is using the data to answer many queries and find answers. Even through it is challenging, I take so much pleasure in seeking the best solution. I enjoy reading and this keeps me updated and keeps my vision sharp. I love communities within them effective knowledge sharing happens. That’s why I decided to combine these two, by co-foundering of two wonderful communities: PyLadies Tunis and Tunis UserR.'
